# Obsidian top-level notes

Purpose: quick index of important operational and design notes stored in the `obsidian/` folder. These files contain runbooks, design decisions, and environment-specific notes referenced by contributors.

Notable files (read these first):
- `obsidian/Cilium System Requirements.md` — Cilium CNI requirements and constraints.
- `obsidian/Cloud-Proxy.md` — cloud-proxy setup and reuse-instance notes.
- `obsidian/cert manager.md` — cert-manager notes and ClusterIssuer examples.
- `obsidian/Firewall Rules (Most Common in GCE).md` — common GCE firewall rules and ports.
- `obsidian/DNSO1.md`, `obsidian/Specific IP Addresses in Your Setup.md` — DNS and IP allocation notes.
- `obsidian/Documentation/repository-mirror/` — this mirror: use it to find path-based docs.

How to use:
- Search for the file that corresponds to the repository path you are editing.
- If you add or rename a folder in the repository, add/update the corresponding mirror doc under `obsidian/documentation/repository-mirror/`.

Maintainers: add yourself to the top of any note you update so others know who to ask.
