# tools

Purpose: Misc developer tools and prompt/template assets used in local workflows.

Key folders:
- `tools/hooks/` — hooks used in local automation
- `tools/prompts/` — prompt templates used by developers
- `tools/websites/` — static site or local website helpers

Notes: Keep tooling lightweight and documented. If you add a tool that requires external dependencies, document how to install them.
