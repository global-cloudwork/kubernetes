Perfect, let’s merge the two ideas. We’ll keep the original brain regions as your flow “bees,” but we’ll fold in the six essential missing pieces into the ones that make the most sense. Here’s how it could look:

The frontal lobe bee—executive functions, planning, decision-making—can take on conflict resolution and deduplication and feedback loops/learning. Those are really about controlling strategy and improving efficiency over time.

The parietal lobe bee—sensory integration and context—fits temporal/contextual reasoning and data validation/cleansing, because it’s about making sense of incoming inputs and keeping them coherent.

The temporal lobe bee—memory and pattern recognition—can handle semantic enrichment, since it’s about linking incoming data to existing knowledge and inferring relationships.

The occipital lobe bee—input decoding—remains focused on data ingestion, parsing raw streams into usable formats, including NLP tasks.

The cerebellum bee—coordination and timing—can manage workflow synchronization and smooth execution of multi-step ingestion tasks, ensuring all bees interact without collisions.

The brainstem bee—core stability and monitoring—can incorporate access control, auditing, and health checks, because it’s about keeping the system alive, secure, and stable.

The limbic system bee—priority and alerting—can handle error detection and anomaly flagging, making sure high-risk or unusual data is surfaced for review.

So essentially, you’ve integrated the “missing” functions without creating extra brain states—you just expanded the responsibilities of the existing ones.

If you want, I can make a compact table with Bee → Responsibilities → N8N Focus → Missing Pieces Folded In so it’s easy to reference while building your flows. Do you want me to do that?
