# Copilot instructions

Keep instructions minimal and structured so language models scan only what's necessary.

## 1) Be brief — use functional decomposition
- Break tasks into the smallest meaningful functions or steps.
- For each step, include only: purpose, inputs, outputs, and side effects (if any).
- Use short examples or command snippets only when they materially speed up solving the task.

## 2) Check the repository README
- Before acting, read `readme.md` in the repository root for project-specific conventions and extra instructions.
- If the README adds constraints or overrides these notes, follow the README and mention the divergence in your response.
